			<p><h2>About me</h2><p>
			<p><h3> Hi! My name is Tom, I am currently a masters student at the University of Leeds, studying Geographical Information Systems.
					At undergraduate I studied at the University of Hull, compleating a 3 year BSc Physical Geography degree in the spring of 2020. As part of that degree
					I developed a real interest in GIS and its aplications across a wide range industries, in particular construction and environmental planning.</h3></p>
					
			<p><h3> To that end, I had been searching for a career that could combine both my interests and background in the phyical environment, with the practical elements of 'real world'
					engineering. I have now been given that opportunity with an engineering consultancy called <a href="https://www.lstc.co.uk/"><span style="color:blue">LSTC</span></a>,
					as an Assitant Planning Engineer, a role I very much look forward to.</h3></p>
					
			<p><h3> My hobies and interests are quite varied. I have always been interested in astronomy and have in the past used my own telescope to find some amazing objects in the night sky, 
					such as the Orion Nebula, the Andromeda Galaxy and Jupiter, unfortunaly I need a much bigger telescope to see it all! I also enjoy flying, being a bit of a nerd when it comes to flight simulation, a hobby
					I have been neglecting recently due to my studies, but one which I have no doubt I'll pick up again.</h3></p>
					
			<p><h2>Skills</h2></p>
			<p><h3>Geographical Information Systems (GIS)</h3></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Specialising in ArcGIS Pro (with experience in QGIS and MapInfo).</li> 
					<li>Compilation and visualisation of spatial data and the analysis thereof, using geoprocessing tools, including the raster calculator, to identify spatial patterns using OLS and Geographically Weighted Regression analysis.</li> 
					<li>Using spatial analyst tools to reclassify data and undertake a Multi Criteria Evaluation of a project area. Understanding of the various interpolation methods used to achieve this.</li> 
					<li>Working with DEMs to derive slope and aspect, creating a Topographic Wetness Index as part of an MCE on agricultural suitability around Leeds. </li> 
					<li>Use of cell and neighbourhood statistics. </li> 
					<li>Use of viewshed and observer points to minimise visual pollution of new potential windfarm sites in East Yorkshire.</li> 
					<li>Conducting network analysis to generate GIS-based measures of accessibility.</li> 
				</ul>
			<p><h3>Data Analysis</h3></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Compilation of independent variables from 3rd party sources to create composite indicators.</li> 
					<li>Competent using the various statistical tools, functions and formulas within each software to process and analyse data, including VLOOKUPS to merge datasets.</li> 
					<li>Creation of linear regression models using bivariate correlation statistics to identify multicollinearity between independent variables. </li> 
				</ul>
			<p><h3>Programming</h3></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Strong foundation in Python, JavaScript and HTML as well as a basic foundation in R Studio, CSS and PHP.</li> 
					<li>Calculation of summary statistics and creation of statistical graphics including scatter plots, Kernel Density Estimates, regression plots, hexbin plots and the mapping of model residuals. </li> 
					<li>Creation of an online map and webpages with added JavaScript functionality.</li> 
					<li>Choropleth mapping using ggplot2 and tmap in R and pandas, seaborn and matplotlib in Python (I have also used many additional packages).  </li> 
				</ul>	
			<p><h3>Remote Sensing</h3></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Experience in ERDAS Imagine digital image processing software.</li> 
					<li>Assessing land use change and identifying different landcover types through the evaluation of spectral reflectance as well as the use of the model maker to build a Normalised Difference Vegetation Index. </li> 
				</ul>	
			<p><h3>Research</h3></p>
				<ul>
					<li>High level of independent research skill. Able to critically analyse and evaluate information from a range of sources and extract the necessary details to aid my own work or that of my team.</li> 
					<li>Able to independently execute research and fieldwork, which was a major part of my dissertation.</li> 
				</ul>
			<p><h3>Communication and Presentation</h3></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Capable of writing critically and presenting results in an accessible manner to a wide range of audiences.</li> 
					<li>A comfortable and confident public speaker whilst presenting work and communicating with clients.</li> 
					<li>Team player who apricates the importance of communication and self-reliance within a team, to maximise effectiveness and ensure good quality work in a timely manner.</li>
